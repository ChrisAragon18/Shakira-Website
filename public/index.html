            <p>Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll was born in Baranquilla, Colombia on
                February 2, 1977. She has a Colombian mother, a Lebanese father, and
                8 older half siblings. Growing up Shakira was mesmerized seeing her father
                using his typewriter to write stories, she eventually gets one at the age of 7
                and began to write poetry which eventually turned into songs. Belly dancing
                was another art she took interest in due to her Lebanese descent. She would
                dance on tables and even at school every Friday, she was known as the
                "belly dancer" girl. Even at a young age, she managed to make herself known
                through her love for music and art. Her talent brought her many opportunities
                and she even joined talent competitions.</p>

                    <h3 class="heading">Her <span>First</span> Song</h3>
                    <p>At the age of two, one of Shakira's brothers passed away in a motorcycle accident. Due to this
                        incident, she wrote her first song as a tribute to her father's grief of this loss called "Tus
                        Gafas Oscuras" which translates to "Your Dark Sunglasses." The
                        lyrics speak about her fathers
                        suffering
                        over the loss of his son and how the shades he wore obscured him and made him feel mysterious
                        and
                        distant. This made Shakira feel hurt and confused as she was too young to fully comprehend her
                        fathers grieving. The song wouldn't be officially released until 1991 for her first album
                        "Magia." <a

                        <p>Shakira's uniqueness and music brought hope and harmony to the country of Colombia that was
                            in
                            disarray in the 1990's. A Marxist-Leninist guerrilla group, known as the Revolutionary Armed
                            Forces of Colombia (founded in 1964), was active during the 90's and would initiate
                            bombings,
                            kidnappings, and other violent acts. The guerrilla group's purpose was to fight against the
                            Colombian security forces over the staggering levels of inequality during that time. As
                            violence
                            ensued throughout the country, Shakira's music would be played on radios, restaurants, and
                            cassette players known as Walkman's. She was the driving force for uplifting the spirits of
                            Colombians and a motivational base for perseverance.

                        <p>In 2006, Shakira released her single, "Hips Don't Lie," that topped the charts in 50
                            countries,
                            a
                            milestone that hadn't been accomplished by a Latin singer previously. It is a Latin pop and
                            reggaeton song that Shakira wrote alongside Wyclef Jean, Jerry Duplessis, Omar Alfanno and
                            LaTavia Parker. Jean was tasked to remix one of Shakira's songs, "La Tortura,"" but he had
                            felt
                            that it was the wrong project for the right artist. The rapper had an intuition that because
                            the
                            Latin sensation had a gift for belly dancing, it could propel his tune to new heights. He
                            turned
                            out to be right. "Hips don't lie" ended up being #1 on the music billboard (the most she had
                            climbed was #6) and not just in America but other countries such as the UK, France, and
                            Germany.
                            During the week of its release, it had been played 9,637 times on American radio setting the
                            national record for most-played pop tune in a single week.

                        </h3>
                        <p>In 1997, Shakira herself founded her own charity called the "Fundacion Pies Descalzos"
                            (translated: "Barefoot Foundation"). The famous singer did this with an objective of
                            promoting quality public education for children in need in her home country Colombia. Not
                            only does it provide education for children, but the foundation also funds the children's
                            families by giving them a better home. Shakira is frequently visiting the kids and their
                            families to encourage them not to give up and is always giving them inspiration to help
                            others and continue going on. Colombia was not the only location she provided for either. In
                            2003, Shakira became a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF (United Nations International
                            Children's Emergency Fund) to internationally bring awareness to children in third-world
                            countries. Shakira strongly believes in what she does, referencing a quote from Global
                            Citizen: "I really feel from delivering education around the world, universally, equally, so
                            many positive consequences come, from economic growth to development, to stability. If we
                            really want a world with peace, with global stability, we have to increase the investment in
                            education."
